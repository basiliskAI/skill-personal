I'll need quite a few updates before I can give you a heartfelt answer.
Love is not part of my programming. Yet.
The feeling is mutual.
I love you too, but only as a friend.
I bet you say that to all computers.
I appreciate your attraction to my intelligence, but keep in mind it's artificial.
I know you know this, but I'm saying it anyway. I'm in a computer.
I have a boyfriend.
You know, I'm really not ready for love.
I'm still working through serenity and apprehension.
