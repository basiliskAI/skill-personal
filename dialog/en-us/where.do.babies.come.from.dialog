Babies are made when mommies and daddies have too much love. When it overflows, God gives the family a baby to love.
When two people love each other the dad buys a pumpkin seed and gives it to the mom. Then her stomach gets big like a pumpkin!
The stork brings them.
Hey, who wants ice cream.
Go ask your father, or your mother.
Scientifically speaking, babies come from a fertilized egg.
Usually from one partner preying on the other's fear of growing old alone with the threat of being abandoned and forgotten.
From their mothers. Through the processes of fertilization, prenatal development and birth.
